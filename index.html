                 <p class="text-success">A nutritious diet is essential to healthy brain development in children, which is critical to good learning.

Our school kitchen team prepares fresh meals every day on site. As well as a range of wholesome, nutritious and delicious snacks and meals for all, the team also provides for students with special dietary needs.

There is a daily morning snack, afternoon snack, and at lunchtime a soup starter and two main courses, one of each being a vegetarian option. Parents are provided with a menu in advance of each week and are able to select the food they would like their children to be served each day.                                                                                                                                                                         
                 
Having good eating habits and a balanced diet supports childrenâ€™s health and wellbeing, and minimises the risk of illness. Eating habits developed in the early years are likely to have a lifelong influence. 

Fruit is naturally available daily.

The school works with the best suppliers that meet stringent criteria and are certified for importing raw materials into the school kitchen.                 </p>

             <p class="text-primary">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.

Student attendance software is designed to record & manage daily student attendance in schools to speed up the daily attendance process & reduce manual work. It is used to track student's attendence, absentee record, attendance history & other related documents.</p>
